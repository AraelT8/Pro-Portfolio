## Description

My React-powered portfolio reflects my mastery in crafting captivating single-page applications. The header offers seamless navigation to key sections: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.

The Portfolio section showcases diverse projects with visuals linking to live apps and GitHub repos. Seamless user prompts ensure accurate form completion. The Resume section provides a downloadable copy and a curated list of my skills. The footer includes essential links for connectivity: email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter. This portfolio harmoniously combines expertise in single-page app development with functionality and aesthetics.
